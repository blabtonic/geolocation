geolocation
===========

This application I created shows all of the closest Tim Hortons that are nearby my home. 

I used a mongoDB database to store the longitudes and latitudes of the Tim Hortons close to my house 

--you will need to mongoimport output.json into database name geolocation and collection name as hortons
